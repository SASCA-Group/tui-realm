## About tui-realm 🖥

tui-realm is a **framework** for [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) which provides a layer to simplify the implementation of terminal user interfaces adding the possibility to work with re-usable component with properties and state, as you'd do in React; but that's not all: the input events are handled through a system based on **Messages**, providing you with the possibility to implement `update` functions as happens in Elm.

And that's also explains the reason of the name: Realm stands for React and Elm.

### Why tui-realm 🤔

Personally I didn't start this project from scratch. I've just decided to make a library out of the already existing code in [termscp](https://github.com/veeso/termscp), which I had just finished at the time I started this project. I thought somebody could have found useful this library.

You might be wondering now how much is this project influenced by the development of termscp. Well, a lot actully, I won't deny this, so don't expect this library to always try to fit the community needs, I'm just providing you with a tool I've made for myself, but that I wanted to share with the community.
