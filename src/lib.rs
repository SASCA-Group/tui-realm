//! # tui-realm
//!
//! tui-realm is a **framework** for [tui](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) to simplify the implementation of terminal
//! user interfaces adding the possibility to work with re-usable components with properties and states,
//! as you'd do in React.
//! But that's not all: the components communicate with the ui engine via a system based on **Messages** and **Events**,
//! providing you with the possibility to implement `update` routines as happens in Elm.
//! In addition, the components are organized inside the **View**, which manages mounting/umounting,
//! focus and event forwarding for you.
//!
//! tui-realm also comes with a standard library of components, which can be added to your dependencies,
//! that you may find very useful.
//!
//! ## Get started üèÅ
//!
//! > ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: currently tui-realm supports these backends: crossterm, termion
//!
//! ### Add tui-realm to your Cargo.toml ü¶Ä
//!
//! If you want the default features, just add tuirealm 1.x version:
//!
//! ```toml
//! tuirealm = "^1.2.0"
//! ```
//!
//! otherwise you can specify the features you want to add:
//!
//! ```toml
//! tuirealm = { version = "^1.2.0", default-features = false, features = [ "derive", "with-termion" ] }
//! ```
//!
//! Supported features are:
//!
//! - `derive` (*default*): add the `#[derive(MockComponent)]` proc macro to automatically implement `MockComponent` for `Component`. [Read more](https://github.com/veeso/tuirealm_derive).
//! - `with-crossterm` (*default*): use [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) as backend for tui.
//! - `with-termion` (*default*): use [termion](https://github.com/redox-os/termion) as backend for tui.
//!
//! > ‚ö†Ô∏è You can enable only one backend at the time and at least one must be enabled in order to build.
//! > ‚ùó You don't need tui as a dependency, since you can access to tui types via `use tuirealm::tui::`
//!
//! ### Create a tui-realm application ü™Ç
//!
//! You can read the guide to get started with tui-realm on [Github](https://github.com/veeso/tui-realm/blob/main/docs/en/get-started.md)
//!
//! ### Run examples üîç
//!Still confused about how tui-realm works? Don't worry, try with the examples:
//!
//!- [demo](https://github.com/veeso/tui-realm/blob/main/examples/demo.rs): a simple application which shows how tui-realm works
//!
//!    ```sh
//!    cargo run --example demo
//!    ```
